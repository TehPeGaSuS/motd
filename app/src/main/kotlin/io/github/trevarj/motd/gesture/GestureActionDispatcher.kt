     * The stock `SYSTEM` preset has no partner of its own, and a leaf that did nothing on a fresh
     * install would be a broken default. It is resolved against what the OS is actually showing and
     * pinned to the opposite side, which is what "toggle" means from an unpinned state. Pinning is
     * also why system-following is switched off: left on, the OS would re-decide the pair on the
