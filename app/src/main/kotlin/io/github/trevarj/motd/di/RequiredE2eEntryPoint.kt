     * The app's own decision journal, so a required-gate failure can carry WHY.

     * Deliberate, not incidental. History paging is a control flow whose outcome is observable only
     * as a row count: which boundary each demand source requested, which gap a fill was pinned to,
     * and which fixed classification ended it are all invisible from the timeline, so a red run
     * reports a number and nothing that explains it. That gap cost eleven CI cycles once already.
     * The logger is off by default and its recorded fields are classification, ids, counts and
     * timestamps only — never message content — which is what makes exporting it into the uploaded
     * artifact tree admissible at all; `fast-suite-privacy.sh` keeps that honest.
