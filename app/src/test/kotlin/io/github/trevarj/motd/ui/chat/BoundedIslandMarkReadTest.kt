/**
 * The viewport mark-read contract, over a real store and the real PagingSource.
 *
 * The defect this file exists for is broadcast-visible: `ChatContent`'s mark-read effect reads
 * at-bottom from the CURRENT paging snapshot but acknowledges `rawNewestAnchor`, the newest row of
 * the whole ROOM, and an advance there uploads a MARKREAD that clears unread on every other client.
 * It was first found inside a bounded deep-jump island, whose index 0 was the island's bottom rather
 * than the room's, and was gated by a second flag derived from that island's window bounds.
 *
 * Islands are retired — there is one unbounded timeline — and the second flag is deliberately gone
 * rather than pinned to `false`, because the same disagreement reappears through a different hole.
 * A deep jump is now a global-index jump: the viewport settles a few hundred indices deep, Paging's
 * `maxSize` drops the newest pages, and everything below the viewport is an unloaded placeholder. So
 * the whole contract now rests on ONE predicate, and these tests state it as four invariants:
 *
 *  1. [deepParkedViewportWithPlaceholdersBelowNeverAcknowledges] — unknown is not "already read".
 *  2. [aViewportWhoseMaterializedRowsReachIndexZeroAcknowledges] — the honest bottom still acks.
 *  3. [aMaterializedIgnoredTailIsStillSkippedPastAndAcknowledged] — the ignorable-tail rule survives.
 *  4. [recentWindowBottomStillMarksTheWholeRoomRead] — sitting at the bottom of a room with an
 *     unfilled interior gap acknowledges `rawNewestAnchor`, INCLUDING the interval the gap covers
 *     that was never stored. That is today's behavior and it is pinned deliberately.
 *
 * Each runs the real gate ([shouldMarkReadFromViewport]) over a window materialized by the real
 * PagingSource, then lets the real [resolveAndAdvanceCurrentReadTarget] run exactly when the gate
 * permits it.
